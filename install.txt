Installation Instructions

		
1. Download and un-tar Java (a JDK not just a JRE)
2. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable
3. Add $JAVA_HOME/bin to your PATH

   to test type: java -version
   you should see something like: java version "1.6.0_11"

4. Download and un-tar Tomcat
5. Set the CATALINA_HOME environment variable
6. Set the CATALINA_PID environment variable to something like $CATALINA_HOME/catalina.pid
   (otherwise 'shutdown.sh -force' don't work correctly)

   to test type: $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh (or sudo $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh if you installed Tomcat as root)
   and point your browser at http://localhost:8080/
   you should see the Tomcat start page.

7. Download and un-tar Ant
8. Add ant to your PATH

   to test type: ant -version
   you should see something like: Apache Ant version 1.7.1 compiled on June 27 2008

9. Download and un-tar JVC from https://sourceforge.net/projects/javaviewcontrol

   to test create a 'hello jvc' web app as follows:

   Let's assume you installed JVC in your ~/dev/jvc/ directory, then you can create a
   'hello_jvc' app by typing:

   ~/dev/jvc$ ant new_project -Dname=hello_jvc
   ~/dev/jvc$ cd ../hello_jvc
   ~/dev/hello_jvc$ ant test
   ~/dev/hello_jvc$ ant rev # (or 'sudo ant rev' if you installed tomcat as root)

   At this point you should be able to go to http://localhost:8080/hello_jvc and see
   your new web app.
